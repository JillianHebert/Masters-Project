# Master's Project

For my masterâ€™s project at University of Wisconsin - La Crosse, I investigated the impacts of variable specification, declaring variables as fixed or random,  and model selection  on parameter estimations and significance levels. These choices can have drastic effects on model performance and subsequent inferences.  This is a vital but difficult part of the modeling process and incorrect choices can lead to results that do not accurately reflect the data. Many researchers have found their papers returned from peer reviewers due to their variable specification or model selection. In many fields, especially the sciences, experiments have a nested design structure, that includes both fixed and random variables. This project aims to investigate the differences in results when variable specification and model selection differ. 

To investigate the differences in results, four model types were compared. The four models differed in the way they handled fixed and random variables. The first model was a linear model that pooled over the random variables. This meant that instead of including the random variable in the model, an average of the response variable was taken by pooling the observations over the random effect. The second model was another linear model that used all variables, but they were all specified as fixed variables in the model, even if the variable was a random effect . The third model was a generalized linear model that specified variables as fixed or random and used a maximum likelihood algorithm to calculate results. The fourth and final model was also a generalized linear model that specified variables as fixed or random, but this model used a restricted maximum likelihood algorithm to produce results.

To further dissect model differences, two simulated data sets were used. These data sets emulated a nested design structure with one significant difference, the treatment effect.  One simulated data set had no treatment effect, while the other had half of the standard deviation of an effect. These two simulated data sets were used to compare the power of the four models. Comparisons were also made between the model's effect size, or confidence intervals,  to identify if certain models had smaller interval widths. To make comparisons by conditions, nine different cases were tested with varying conditions, such as sample size, to assess how each model changed. This allowed for comparisons across the four different models, as well as identifying how each model did in comparison to itself under different conditions.

The two empirical data sets used for this project both come from U.S. Geological Survey. Due to privacy restrictions, the data sets used could not be posted in this repository. The data file that has been included was used to change the inputs for the simulated data to determine how models change under conditions like sample size, within subject size, and between subject size.
